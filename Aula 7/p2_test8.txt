Hole argument and Entwurf theory

While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory. 
He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. 
He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.

In June 1913, the Entwurf ('draft') theory was the result of these investigations. 
As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. 
After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken[232] and abandoned the theory in November 1915.
